      <h1> Roger Davenport</h1>
      <h2> Student</h2>
      <p> I am a midlife student.
          I left South Africa approximately 17 years ago. My wife and I moved to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/London,+UK/@51.4952703,-0.0383595,14.33z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99!8m2!3d51.5073509!4d-0.1277583"> London </a>, England.
          After spending 2 years there we moved to Seattle. I have a son who is almost 9 years old.
          I have been doing the same job (which i hated) for almost 15 years. I have quit my job and
          decided to learn coding.
          I am really excited to be studying coding at Codefellows.</p>
